Detach - A Chrome and Firefox Extension to interrupt doomscrolling and redirect your attention toward healthier habits. Development for mobile devices will begin at a later date.

Doomscrolling — endlessly scrolling through negative feeds; drains time and mental energy.

Detach helps by detecting when you’ve been scrolling too long and gently intervening:

- Adds a pause before continuing
- Shows an overlay that asks whether to keep scrolling or to take a break

Features:
Scroll-time tracking — detects when you exceed a threshold in supported sites

    Overlay intervention — blocks the feed and asks if you really want to continue

    Usage dashboard (planned)
