Detach - A Chrome and Firefox Extension to interrupt doomscrolling and redirect your attention toward healthier habits.

Doomscrolling — endlessly scrolling through negative feeds — drains time and mental energy.

Detach helps by detecting when you’ve been scrolling too long and gently intervening:

- Adds a pause before continuing
- Shows an overlay with reflection prompts or breathing exercises
- Tracks your streak of "breaking the scroll

Features:
Scroll-time tracking — detects when you exceed a threshold in supported sites

    Overlay intervention — blocks the feed and asks if you really want to continue

    Positive alternatives — reflection prompts, breathing exercises (coming soon)
